# 🛡️ Protego AI

**Protego AI** is an **AI-powered sentinel for DeFi** — protecting users, managing risks, and optimizing yield across decentralized finance protocols.  

It makes DeFi **safer and smarter** by combining **AI, blockchain security, and automation** — while giving users the choice between **non-custodial** and **custodial** yield strategies.

## ⚙️ What the Platform Does  

### 🔍 1. Real-Time Threat Detection  
- Monitors blockchain transactions, liquidity pools, and smart contracts.  
- Uses AI models to detect **rug pulls, flash loan attacks, MEV exploits, and abnormal fund flows**.  
- Issues **instant alerts** and (future) automated defense actions.  

### 📊 2. Portfolio Monitoring & Analytics  
- Aggregates a user’s positions, staked assets, and yield opportunities.  
- Provides **risk scores** per asset/position.  
- Highlights exposure to vulnerable protocols **in real-time**.  

### 💰 3. Yield Optimization & Staking  
- Identifies **safe staking opportunities** directly from the wallet.  
- Recommends strategies balancing **security + returns**.  
- Supports:  
  - **Non-custodial staking** → users keep control.  
  - **Custodial staking** → via our smart contracts.  

### 🤖 4. AI Agent Integration  
- **DeFi Guardian Agent** → monitors threats & anomalies.  
- **Portfolio Manager Agent** → suggests yield strategies.  
- **Compliance & Safety Agent** → flags suspicious wallets & protocol risks.  

### 🧩 5. Seamless Frontend Integration  
- Built as a **plug-and-play dashboard UI** for DeFi.  
- Provides **REST + gRPC APIs** for alerts & recommendations.  
- Native support for **Duck Mainnet/Testnet/Devnet**, with expansion to **Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum**, and more.
